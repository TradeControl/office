# UK Vat Online

The UK Revenue and Customs service introduced new regulations in 2019 for the submission of 
quarterly VAT returns. Returns must be uploaded via Making Tax Digital (MTD) approved 
software which links to the company's business management software.

Trade Control utilises an inexpensive and simple solution to allow VAT returns to be 
uploaded to a third party MTD approved service via a .csv file which is generated in the
Invoice Register. All of the data required for the VAT return is stored in 
Invoice Register/Vat Totals and a .csv file is generated by selecting the Period
in Vat Totals and clicking on "generate csv export file" below the Totals.

## Installation

The installer gives the client the ability to output the vat return in the required format.

The .csv file should be saved to a suitable folder to enable it to be selected when submitting the 
return to HMRC via the third party software.  The software can be purchased from 1 Click 
Accounts (www.1clickaccounts.com) and the cost at time of writing (July 2019) was £9.95 per annum.

Simply log into the website and click the "SELECT CSV" button to upload the relevant quarterly return.

This method of uploading VAT returns to the MTD service is simple and inexpensive and complies
with the 2019 HMRC requirements.
